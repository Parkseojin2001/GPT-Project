It is a run-down apartment complex with glass doors, gritty dust, and a hallway that smells of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. The building has a faulty lift, and Winston has to climb seven flights of stairs to reach his flat. Inside, there is a telescreen that cannot be completely shut off, and a poster with the caption \"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU\" hangs on the wall. The building is located in London, the chief city of Airstrip One, and is part of the grimy landscape of the city.')"
